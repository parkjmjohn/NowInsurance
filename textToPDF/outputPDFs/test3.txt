The enclosed information is released by the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) for restricted use under the provisions of Title IV of Public
Law 99-660, the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, as amended; Section 1921 of the Social Security Act; and Section 1128E of the
Social Security Act.

Title IV established the NPDB as an information clearinghouse to collect and release certain information related to malpractice payment history
and professional competence or conduct of physicians, dentists, and other licensed health care practitioners.

Section 1921 of the Social Security Act expanded the scope of the NPDB. Section 1921 was enacted to protect program beneficiaries from
unfit health care practitioners, and to improve the anti-fraud provisions of federal and state health care programs. Section 1921 authorizes the
NPDB to collect certain adverse actions taken by state licensing and certification authorities, peer review organizations, and private
accreditation organizations, as well as final adverse actions taken by state law or fraud enforcement agencies (including, but not limited to,
state law enforcement agencies, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and state agencies administering or supervising the administration of a
state health care program), against health care practitioners, health care entities, providers and suppliers.

Section 1128E of the Social Security Act was added by Section 221(a) of Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996. The statute established a national data collection program (formerly known as the Healthcare Integrity and
Protection Data Bank) to combat fraud and abuse in health care delivery and to improve the quality of patient care. Section 1128E information
is now collected and disclosed by the NPDB as a result of amendments made by Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, Public Law
111-148. Section 1128E information includes certain final adverse actions taken by federal agencies and health plans against health care
practitioners, providers, and suppliers.

Regulations governing the NPDB are codified at 45 CFR part 60. Responsibility for operating the NPDB resides with the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and HRSA, Division of Practitioner Data Banks.

Reports from the NPDB contain limited summary information and should be used in conjunction with information from other sources in granting
privileges, or in making employment, affiliation, contracting or licensure decisions. NPDB responses may contain more than one report on a
particular incident, if two or more actions were taken as a result of a single incident (e.g., an exclusion from a federal or state health care
program and an adverse licensure action). The NPDB is a flagging system, and a report may be included for a variety of reasons that do not
necessarily reflect adversely on the professional competence or conduct of the subject named in the report.

All information received from the NPDB is considered confidential and must be used solely for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Further,
ANY PERSON WHO VIOLATES THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS AS SPECIFIED IN TITLE IV OF PUBLIC LAW 99-660, AS
AMENDED, IS SUBJECT TO A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY OF UP TO $11,000 FOR EACH VIOLATION. Subjects of reports who obtain
information about themselves from the NPDB are permitted to share that information with anyone they choose.

If you require additional assistance, visit the NPDB web site (https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov) or contact the NPDB Customer Service Center at 1-
800-767-6732 (TDD: 1-703-802-9395). Information Specialists are available to speak with you weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (5:30
